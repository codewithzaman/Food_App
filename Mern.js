// Introduction to MERN Stack
// MERN stands for MongoDB , ExpressJs , React and Node used for full stack developement
// MongoDB - Document DataBase
// ExpressJs- Node.js web framework
// ReactJs- a client side JS Library
// Node.js- JS web server
// How MERN Stack Work 
// The Mern Stack architecture allows you to easliy construct a 3-tier architecture (Frontend-backend and database) entirely using javascript and JSON.
// MongoDB-- No SQL database used for high-Volume Storage, Open source documented oriented database, It stores data in JSON Format, can be easliy used with node, MongoDB uses BOSON to query database, Documents containing key value pairs are the basic units of data in MongoDB.
// Node.js-- is used to run javascript on server, it is free and open source and its code is written in C++. Node.js runs single-threaded, non blocking , asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.
// Where to use Node.js-- Back-end services such as APIs.Highly Scalable, data intensive and real time apps, I/O bounds apps, Single page applications,
// Where not to use Node.js-- Node.js is not used in CPU-intensive apps which requires calculations done by CPU.
// Express JS-- Flexible Node.js Framework that provides robust set of features for web and mobile applications. it provides easy routing of requests based on HTTP methods and URLs, it allows to setup middle wares to respond to HTTP requests, allows to dynamically render HTML pages based on passing arguments to templates.
//React JS-- is a JS library for building user interfaces for mobile and web applications, used to build single page application, allows u to create resubale UI components , React router to handle the front end routing.
// Why React JSX(JavaScript XML) makes it easier and simpler to write react components , reactJs supports components. These components also promote code reuseability and make the overall web application easier to understand and debug.
// How does react work-- instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly , react creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating before making the changes in the browsers DOM. React finds out what changes have been made and changes what needs to be changed.
